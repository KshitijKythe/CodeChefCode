# CodeChefCode

This repo is created to document all the successfull submissions done by Kshitij Kythe on CodeChef. Since my progress on CodeChef is minimal and basic, so you might see code which is itself trivial in nature. Another reason of mine to create this repo is so that I may get comfortable with GitHub.

Happy Coding!!!
